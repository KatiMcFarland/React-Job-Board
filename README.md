# React-Job-Board
-Used React, Material UI, JSON, Redis, Node.js, and Express to create this dynamic app to aid junior developers in their search for a job 
-I created this to refresh every hour with the help of cron, as well as used an algorithm to filter out senior position job openings 
-Future Improvements: 
1. CSS for better UI/UX
2. Add additional APIs 
3. Upgrade algorithm to be more accurate
